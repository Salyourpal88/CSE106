    <p class = p1> Welcome to the the first deliquent on our list! Where to start!? Each of these Gargoyles has 5,600 each. For a grand total of 11,200 hp. Making it one of the highest life point enemies in the whole game. Each gargoyle has a different weapon (Twinblade and Greatsword), so the player will need to learn 2 different move sets. These enemies have complete immunity to all status effects along with high damage reduction to all damage types except strike. These enemies will hold uneven hostility and will attack the player in successive order. Each boss has the ability to breathe out poison that can deal damage, stagger, and induce poison the player. Lastly, the Gargoyles with the twinblade will become enraged at 25% health, so it will start to deal and attack recklessly.</p>
