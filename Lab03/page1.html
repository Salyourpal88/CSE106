    <p class = p1> Welcome to the the second deliquent on our list! Where to start!? Each Crucible Knight has a different weapon (Great Spear and Greatsword), so the player will need to learn 2 different move sets again just like Gargoyles. These enemies have complete immunity to bleed and highest resistances to all other status effects, so the player has less options to handle the fight. Along with that Crucible Knights have high damage reduction to all damage types. These enemies will hold uneven hostility and will attack the player in successive order, as well as the added difficulty of the Great Spear Crucible Knight being able to attack passed the hit box of the Greatsword Crucible Knight. Each boss has the ability to stagger through stomps and do huge chuncks of damage with each swing. The poise on this enemey is extremely high, on top of that with the constant attention their poise will recover if not attacked in quick succession. Each Crucible Knight when brought to 50% health will gain extra abilities such as wing attacks, tail attacks, and powered weapon attacks.</p>
    <h3> Tips! </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Try to use weapons, spells, or items that induce poise break as hard as that may be </li>
        <li> Use summons to split the attention of the boss </li>
        <li> Use a shield with high stability and 100% damage reduction </li>
        <li> Deal with one Crucible Knight at a time </li>
    </ul>
